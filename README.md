1. [02/01/2022] - [what it is?](https://www.educative.io/blog/system-design-primer#what)
2. [03/01/2022] [Kinds of System]<br>
    - Horizontal Scaling<br>
    - Vertical Scaling <br>
    - Monolithic application<br>
    - Micro services<br>
3. [04/01/2022] <br>
    - Requirement Clarification (Functional & Non-Functional)<br>
    - Estimation of Important data (queries/traffic/storage)<br>
    - Data Flow (Data model & How data will flow)
      & [choosing Databases](https://www.educative.io/blog/database-design-tutorial) <br>
    - High level design & Detailed Design <br>
    - Identifying Bottlenecks/Resolve from Detailed Design & mitigating them

4. [05/01/2022] [HW/SW](https://www.educative.io/blog/hardware-vs-software-components-computer) <br>
    - Architectural Design - Abstract Version <br>
    - HighLevel Design - part break down into sub system and modules <br>
    - Detailed Design - implementation <br>

[System design fundamentals]

5. [06/01/2022] [System design fundamentals](https://www.educative.io/blog/complete-guide-to-system-design) <br>
    - Scalability - Scaling(Horizontal/Vertical)<br>
    - [Microservice Architecture](https://www.educative.io/blog/complete-guide-to-system-design#microservices) <br>
    - [Proxy Server](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-a-proxy-server) <br>
        1. forward proxy<br>
        2. separate user from website (what they are browsing)<br>
        3. Privacy/Speed/Bandwidth/Activity logging<br>
    - [CAP Theorem](https://www.educative.io/blog/what-is-cap-theorem#whatiscaptheorem) <br>
        1. Consistency : all nodes see same data (most recent write while read across all servers)<br>
        2. Availability : (distributed systems) should respond without failure (but not gurantee on response with most
           recent write)<br>
        3. Partition Tolerance : break in communication b/w nodes (system does not fail)<br>
        4. PACELC Theorem - build on CAP & states that an additional trade-off exists: between latency and
           consistency.<br>
