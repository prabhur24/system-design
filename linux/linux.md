1. Linux <- Unix
2. Linux -> More distributions ubuntu,debian,kali,Suse,Fedora... (purpose)
3. Linux is not unix
4. Linux kernel
    1. software program that communicates with hardware
    2. manages resources,process,memory...
5. Linux Torvalds (also created version control git)
6. Richard stallman - free s/w activist,free s/w foundation GNU
7. GNU + linux kernel combined
8. ISO -> CD/USB(hd) -> Booting into hard drive (pyshical drive)

9. Linux Architecture
    1. H/W - peripheral devices (RAM,HDD,CPU...)
    2. Kernel - virtualizes h/w resources,manages resources,process,io,file,device,memory,mitigate conflicts b/w
       different process
        1. types - monolythic,micro,hybrid,exo
        2. System library - implement (special type of functions) the functionality to Operatin system
    3. Shell - interface to kernel (hide complexities of kernel function , take command for user and executes it)
    4. Application & Utilities
        1. Utlity - provide OS functionalities to user

10. Kernel - Core Subsystems
    1. Process Scheduler - responsible for sharing CPU time across all processes
    2. Memory Management Unit - responsible for sharing memory space across all processes,separate virtual address
       spaces for each of the processes.
    3. Virtual Filesystem - Unified Interface to access 'stored data' from different filesystem
    4. Network subsystem
    5. Inter-process communication

11. Working with Directories 
    1. mkdir
    2. rmdir
    
12. Working with files
    1. file 
    2. touch
    3. cat
    4. echo
    5. rm
    6. copy
    7. move
    8. more
    9. less
    10. head
    11. tail
